### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (One thing I learned in this assignment is how to add a code that will clear everything previous accrued. Using getElementId allows the program to find the ID you specify. Once it is specified it is overwritten with the new string that you inputte, which was an empty string.)
2. (Peforming a math equation/statement is another lesson I learned. Calculating a percentage from a number that the user inputs was the code created in this assignment. First the value of an id (ex: householdId) is taken and later on inserted into an equation. That equation transfers it into a percentage. 
3. (The most important step to creating programs like this is initalizing variables/Ids. This is the first step you must do before creating equations and statements. I started my file by creating the ids for everything I would be dealing with. For example, the household id was initialized by inserting: id="householdPercentage")
